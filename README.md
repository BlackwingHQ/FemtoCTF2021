# Blackwing FemtoCTF 2021

FemtoCTF is a tiny CTF we made to help us identify qualified candidates to join our team of security researchers. Unlike traditional _Capture the Flag_ games, this CTF is quite small and shouldn't require any crazy leaps of faith. It shouldn't be too difficult to complete if you have experience in code auditing, developing exploits / PoCs, and basic reverse engineering.

If the description below sounds like a good fit for you, we'd love to talk (and at least send you some stickers!). 
Find the flag at https://FemtoCTF2021.clownshoes.party and send it along with your resume to jobs@blackwinghq.com.

## Who are we?
We're a deliberately small team that primarily provides product security assurance, engineering, and research services to select customers including top-tier technology and financial organizations.
